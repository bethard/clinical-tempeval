<p>
	Participants in Clinical TempEval may participate in any or all of the 6 tasks (TS, ES, TA, EA, DR, CR). The evaluation metrics that will be applied are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		TS, ES: precision, recall and F1</li>
	<li>
		TA, EA: precision, recall and F1 for each attribute</li>
	<li>
		DR: precision, recall and F1</li>
	<li>
		CR: precision, recall and F1, and closure-based precision, recall and F1, where temporal closure is run to infer additional relations on both the system and the reference relations and scores are calculated on the post-closure relations.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The focus of Clinical TempEval 2017 is on domain adaptation from a source domain (colon cancer) to a target domain (brain cancer). To allow the evaluation of both unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches to domain adaptation, Clinical TempEval 2017 will have multiple evaluation phases:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
		Trial phase (identical to Clinical TempEval 2016):
		<ul>
			<li>
				Training data:
				<ul>
					<li>
						raw text from the train and dev sections of the source domain (colon cancer)</li>
					<li>
						annotations from the train and dev sections of the source domain (colon cancer)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Test data:
				<ul>
					<li>
						raw text from the test section of the source domain (colon cancer)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Unsupervised domain adaptation phase:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Training data:
				<ul>
					<li>
						raw text from the source domain (colon cancer)</li>
					<li>
						annotations from the source domain (colon cancer)</li>
					<li>
						raw text from the target domain (brain cancer)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Test data:
				<ul>
					<li>
						raw text from the target domain (brain cancer)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Semi-supervised domain adaptation phase:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Training data:
				<ul>
					<li>
						raw text from the source domain (colon cancer)</li>
					<li>
						annotations from the source domain (colon cancer)</li>
					<li>
						raw text from the target domain (brain cancer)</li>
					<li>
						annotations from the target domain (brain cancer)<br />
						<strong>[only available during the evaluation period]</strong></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Test data:
				<ul>
					<li>
						raw text from the target domain (brain cancer)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
<h3>
	System Output Format</h3>
<p>
	The format of submissions is the same for both phase 1 and phase 2. Your system output should take the same format and organization as the Anafora XML files in the training data. Your directory structure should look like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		ID004_clinic_010
		<ul>
			<li>
				ID004_clinic_010.Temporal-Relation.system.completed.xml</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		ID004_clinic_012
		<ul>
			<li>
				ID004_clinic_012.Temporal-Relation.system.completed.xml</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		ID004_path_011
		<ul>
			<li>
				ID004_path_011.Temporal-Relation.system.completed.xml</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		ID005_clinic_013
		<ul>
			<li>
				ID005_clinic_013.Temporal-Relation.system.completed.xml</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		...
  </li>
</ul>
